# Financial Times - Europe’s fastest-growing companies

Europe’s fastest-growing companies [report](https://www.ft.com/content/8b37a92b-15e6-4b9c-8427-315a8b5f4332) lists the European companies that achieved the highest compound annual growth rate in revenue between 2016 and 2019.

I was curious to explore better some aspects of this reports, like the possible correlation between growth and employees number, or industrial categories that have grown more in my country.

Python notebook with my analysis is available [here for 2020 version](/EuropesFastestGrowingCompanies2020.ipynb) and [here for 2021 version](/EuropesFastestGrowingCompanies2021.ipynb) .
