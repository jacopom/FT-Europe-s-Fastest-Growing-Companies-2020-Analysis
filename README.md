# Financial Times - Europe’s fastest-growing companies

Europe’s fastest-growing companies [report](https://www.ft.com/content/691390ca-53d9-11ea-90ad-25e377c0ee1f) lists the European companies that achieved the highest compound annual growth rate in revenue between 2015 and 2018.

I was curious to explore better some aspects of this reports, like the possible correlation between growth and employees number, or industrial categories that have grown more in my country.

Python notebook with my analysis is available [here](/EuropesFastestGrowingCompanies2020.ipynb).
